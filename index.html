                        <p class="text-center"><span class="by">by</span> <a href="https://dhanushg77.github.io/dhanushgowda/">Dhanush Gowda</a><br><span class="date">FEB 20th,2021</span></p><img class="img-fluid" src="img/1.jpg" style="width: auto; height: 300px"></div>
                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Alcohol’s impact on your body starts from the moment you take your first sip. While an occasional glass of wine with dinner isn’t a cause for concern, the cumulative effects of drinking wine, beer, or spirits can be a serious issue.</h3>
                        <h4>Brain Shrinks</h4>
                        <p>If you drink heavily for a long time, it can affect how your brain looks and works. Its cells start to change and even get smaller. Too much alcohol can actually shrink your brain. And that’ll have big effects on your ability to think, learn, and remember things. It can also make it harder to keep a steady body temperature and control your movements. </p>
                        <h4>Stomach Acid Increses</h4>
                        <p>Alcohol irritates the lining of your stomach and makes your digestive juices flow. When enough acid and alcohol build up, you get nauseated and you may throw up. Years of heavy drinking can cause painful sores called ulcers in your stomach. And high levels of stomach juices mean you won’t feel hungry. That’s one reason long-term drinkers often don’t get all the nutrients they need. </p>
                        <h4>Leads to Liver Diseases</h4>
                        <p>Your liver breaks down almost all the alcohol you drink. In the process, it handles a lot of toxins. Over time, heavy drinking makes the organ fatty and lets thicker, fibrous tissue build up. That limits blood flow, so liver cells don’t get what they need to survive. As they die off, the liver gets scars and stops working as well, a disease called cirrhosis.</p>
                        <h4>Change in Body Temperature</h4>
                        <p>Alcohol widens your blood vessels, making more blood flow to your skin. That makes you blush and feel warm and toasty. But not for long. The heat from that extra blood passes right out of your body, causing your temperature to drop. On the other hand, long-term, heavy drinking boosts your blood pressure. It makes your body release stress hormones that narrow blood vessels, so your heart has to pump harder to push blood through. </p>
                        <h4>Weaker Immune System</h4>
                        <p>You might not link a cold with a night of drinking, but there might be a connection. Alcohol puts the brakes on your immune system. Your body can’t make the numbers of white blood cells it needs to fight germs. So for 24 hours after drinking, you’re more likely to get sick. Long-term, heavy drinkers are much more likely to get illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis. </p>

                        <p>Alcohol may give you a temporary relief from the present situations but not permanently. Once you get out of the hangover, the situation may get more worsend. So be wise , do learn the effects before consuming alcohol.</p>
